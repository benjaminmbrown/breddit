Here's an angular project I was working on sin early 2014.. It is a simple Reddit clone where users can post links to websites, vote on those links, and comment on them. It was built with Angular, bootstrap, and firebase (along with the angularfire library) as the data store.

Here's what the firebase data looks like :

Currently, users can:
<ul>
	<li>See all posts when not logged in (but no posting, voting, or commenting)</li>
	<li>Click post comments &amp; view</li>
	<li>Click on user name to see user profile Â and all of that user's associated comments and posts</li>
	<li>Register as a new user</li>
	<li>Login as an existing user</li>
	<li>Post new content (when logged in)</li>
	<li>Comment on a post (when logged in)</li>
	<li>Upvote or Downvote a post (when logged in)</li>
</ul>
